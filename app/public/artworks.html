									<br>
									<p><b>Team:</b> James Green, Maia Smith, Jodi Crisp, Catherine Jones, Mike Alger, Tom Flynn</p>
									<h4>Description:</h4>
									<p>The Museum of Lies is an exploration of how the stories of historical objects can be told, retold ... and falsified.</p>
									<p>Our creation grew from the premise that Museums (capital M) don’t always tell the whole truth - think of replica masterpieces or conjecture in object descriptions - or leave out parts of an objects story that are considered incompatible with the ‘official’ narrative (e.g. the ‘Elgin Marbles’).</p>
									<p>Our team ended up creating two ways to present such concepts through interactive experience: </p>
									<ul>
										<li>A VR museum that presented 3D scans of objects in a replica of the actual space the user was in (we 3D scanned the Ravensbourne college foyer!) and pulled in an infinite stream of altered and falsified Wikipedia articles related to them, displaying the text in realtime in the 3D environment.</li>
										<li>An Arduino based physical interface that used 3D printed artefacts to trigger an information display pulling in the same edited Wikipedia descriptions, complete with rotary controllers to ‘turn up the lies’.</li>
									</ul>

								<h3><a id="getthebanana">Jury Prize: Get the Banana</a></h3>
								<br>
								<p><b>Team:</b> Chris Brown, Scott Wooden</p>
								<p>Our project Get The Banana is a wikipedia powered word association game. The objective is to get to the wikipedia page “Banana” by navigating through other pages and thinking of words to get you closer to that page. The aim is to get to banana in the fewest words as possible! One of many challenges was ensuring the Wikipedia API returned the correct links from each page to give us an extensive selection of words related to that topic. Another challenge were the different edge cases at which the user could type in these words, such as matching all caps, no caps, spaces, hyphens and the user of multiple words. It was a challenge deciding what word formats could be deemed as correct and what couldn’t.</p>
								<p>The technologies we used we’re well known web application frameworks such as node.js  for the backend and the popular MVC framework backbone.js to handle the different views and game functions.</p>

								<h3><a id="steppingstones">Stepping stones</a></h3>
								<br>
								<p><b>Team:</b> Gregory White, Jennifer Munroe, Joe Shellard, Cliff Hammett, Tina Pedersen, Tomek</p>
								<p>On the floor are a set of triangular tiles, each containing one of four symbols: a square, triangle, star, and cross. Each player (of which there were two, though further iterations could allow for more) is given a small deck of laser-cut cards, each card displaying one symbol. Players take turns to place down a card, and the opponent has to move to a tile displaying the correct symbol. Once a tile has been stepped on it becomes deactivated; if it is stepped on again, the player who does so loses the game. The aim of the game therefore is to outsmart your opponent and force them onto a deactivated tile.</p>

								<h3><a id="emoti">Emoti</a></h3>
									<br>
									<p><b>Team:</b> Dream Emoti team: Ian Black, Katherine F Hudson, Milton De Paula, Bawar Jalal, Elizabeth Corbin, Caroline Y Zheng, Yasmin Curren</p>
									<p>Emoti shows the emotional state of the world through combined visual colours and audio, resulting in a beautifully chaotic representation of the emotional state of the world- or at least the twitterverse.</p>
									<p>Using Twitter Widgets we were able to pull keywords from tweets being posted in realtime and assign them to different emotion types. The emotions we used were: Happy, Sad, Surprised, Afraid and Angry. From this data we created a simple HTML web-page with 5 divs, or blocks, of colour relating to the different emotion states. These would constantly change width depending on the data that was being collected from the tweets to give a visual representation of how many people were tweeting under each emotion:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Green = Happy</li>
										<li>Blue = Sad</li>
										<li>Yellow = Surprised</li>
										<li>Pink = Afraid</li>
										<li>Red = Angry</li>
									</ul>

									<p>To make this experience more immersive, these visual representations are also accompanied with audio. We chose five audio tracks, one to depict each emotion, adding them into the web-page using the HTML5 audio tag, and adjusted their volume depending on the emotion-based twitter data with some JavaScript wizardry. This ended up with the clashing music types seemingly battling against each other, reflecting how hectic the live emotion states were and how rapidly they would change.</p>

									<p>As this was an Art Hackathon we wanted to present this data in a beautiful and intriguing way. What better than creating the illusion of 3D colour-changing ripples?!</p>

									<p><b>Team:</b>Ana Nicolau, Alexandre Gondim</p>
									<p>A living organic digital piece, a Holocaust memento, that uses documentary image repetition and a gas chamber door sound on page load to create a one-off visual imprint of awareness of an historic moment that defined the world as we know it.</p>

									<h3><a id="allsmokenomirrors">All smoke, no mirrors</a></h3>
									<p><b>Team:</b>Richard Colson, Gerred Blyth</p>
									<p>Team member Gerred brought dry ice producing equipment and the projector. The team ran into trouble on the first day when they found that the laser they planned to use was not strong enough to be picked up by a small mirror that was being rotated with a motor. Russell had gone to considerable trouble to create a dark cubicle type environment for maximum effectiveness of the projection.</p>
									<p>On the second day after some soul searching, Gerred and Richard had to pull something out of the bag. They simplified the intention and ended up projecting graphic shapes on the vapour in the cubicle, using Dan Shiffman's Processing library to identify a user's hand at a certain distance from a Kinect 360. They had never worked with light in this way before and both were surprised at the way they had been able to link the light with hand movements</p>

									<h3><a id="fuckkermitup">Fuck Kermit up</a></h3>
									<p><b>Team: </b>Katie, Xavi Sole</p>
									<p>The team wanted to create something useless, but within the theme of trickery. After 10 minutes Team Kermit comprised of a project manager and a programer came up with the idea to "Fuck Kermit Up". They hooked an arduino to Kermit so that he would yell out obscenities when punched. Think Tickle Me Elmo but with a kick. Then they produced a video with VFX to make it look like they had sawn Kermit in half and tortured him beyond belief. It was all in the name of good fun and they proved that artists do have a place in a Hackathon.</p>
