						<h1>Ethnography - participant diaries</h1>
					</div>
					
					<h2>Method</h2>
					<p>One method we used to conduct research on group formation during the hackathon was diaries of thoughts and impressions collected at semi-random intervals during the weekend.  The diaries would allow us to collect research individual, anonymizable, private thoughts that participants may not have been comfortable expressing among the hackathon group.  Further, comparing this information to the participant-observation conducted during the event would allow us to gain additional insight into the differences between observed and self-reported outcomes.</p>
					<p>Each person who signed up was prompted by email to submit a diary at six predetermined intervals (three for each day).  The times were unique to each participant for two reasons: we hypothesized that if the diary submission times were staggered it would have less disruptive impact on team working time overall, and the process of producing the diaries would be more individualized as people described different aspects of each day.  In practice we found that people submitted each diary whenever was most suitable to them after receiving each prompt, so unified prompt times would probably not have made a difference.</p>
					<p>Of the six participants who signed up for the diaries, two people responded to every prompt.  Everyone responded to at least two prompts.  Most entries were very brief, ranging between just a single word to about 100 words; a typical entry was about 45 words.</p>
					
					<h2>Diaries</h2>
					<h3>First Round</h3>
					<p>In the first round of diaries, the main expressions were excitement, anxiety, and sleepiness or need for caffeine.  The creative energy of knowing that something interesting is going to happen but not yet knowing what that will be opened the first day for most people.  One participant said “I love this phase when you don't know anyone or the final pieces that will come out of the event.”  This was echoed in another participant’s diary: “My nerves have now turned into excitement and I can't wait to see what's in store for the day.”</p>
					
					<h3>Second Round</h3>
					<p>Round 2 of the diaries principally focused on the ideas-formation stage and the value of the inspirational talks by artists on the morning of the first day.  One person described “A whirlwind of inspiration from the talks so far;” another mentioned that the talks “helped me to understand the possibilities and limitations of technology.”  People also discussed team-formation during this stage, with the entries largely upbeat.  The framework of Tuckman’s stages of group development (commonly summarised as forming, norming, storming and performing) describes the experiences of participants through the weekend as seen through the medium of the diaries.  For a critical literature review on the stages of group development and alternate, non-linear models, see Gersick’s 1988 new model of group development.  I have chosen to focus this discussion around Tuckman’s framework because there was a naturally progressive sense to the feedback received in this way, though it may be that the method itself affected participants’ perception of their own experience by encouraging them to reflect in a procedural and narrative manner on the events of the weekend.  This may make the feedback we received through diaries appear more stage-wise than feedback received through other means like participant-observation.</p>
					<p>The second round of diary entries seemed to be describing the ‘Forming’ stage, where group members are eager, questioning and sociable, and principally concerned with the group’s identity as a whole rather than their individual role in it. A typical entry read: “Everyone is getting along well, bouncing ideas off each other and generally getting to know one another :)”.  Another common theme for the second round of diaries was the minor frustrations around getting wifi and other equipment set up to get ready for prototyping.</p>
					
					<h3>Third Round</h3>
					<p>The diaries became more sparse after the second prompt.  My sense is that as the pressure to produce results became more urgent through the weekend, it became easier to ignore the diaries prompt in favour of more immediate technical concerns.</p>
					<p>Of the people that responded to the third prompt, the energy was still very high and principally focused on the excitement of seeing progress on technical and artistic ideas becoming a reality.  A typical entry reads: “Wow.... my first proper hackathon & I'm so impressed by the concentration levels and output... so productive. I'm still so excited (& I have a low attention threshold!) Really nice to be working with people who have different expertise to me. So refreshing!”</p>
					<p>One person did also express frustration with the speed of technical progress at this point, saying “...looking forward to getting on with some code but still learning a lot about physical objects!”  There was also a more reflective quality to the third entries, coming as they did near the end of day 1.  Rather than discussing their immediate surroundings or progress, some diaries tried to encapsulate a sense of the full day’s developments.</p>
					<p>The organisers’ diaries for prompt 3 both focused on the changing atmosphere throughout the day, with each observing that the hectic feeling of the early afternoon began to gel into a more productive phase towards evening.  One said, “During the first part people were working very intensely and were difficult to talk to.” Another organiser observed that later on, “It became calmer, the music was relaxing and everyone seemed to be getting on and busy. It's the kind of atmosphere that you sit back and observe quietly with a smile.”</p>
					
					<h3>Fourth Round</h3>
					<p>The fourth prompt came early in the second day when people were trying to accomplish as much as they could in the remaining time.  These entries continued to reflect Tuckman’s stages of group development in the ‘Storming’ and ‘Norming’ patterns, with one entry describing the struggle to integrate one’s individual role with the team’s purpose: “Didn't sleep much last night as my head was occupied trying to resolve some of my group's issues[...] have to let go of my inner art critic who is questioning my conceptual rigour.... that is not the point of a hackathon (or is it?)”  (The ellipsis in brackets is mine to indicate an excerpt; the other is stylistic in the original diary text.)  Another described the group finally coalescing on an idea and gaining a sense of momentum: “We have given up with the LED strip, finally. Now we've changed our idea completely and are frantically working towards making it happen. GO, GO GO!”</p>
					
					<h3>Fifth Round</h3>
					<p>The fifth diaries occurred during peak productive time in the second day.  One participant’s fifth entry simply read “Stress.”  Several people left responding to their 5th diary until they were out of the fray, causing both the 5th and 6th diaries to be reflections on the entire experience rather than on that moment in the creative process.  One person acknowledged having missed their 5th diary in a later subission: “Sorry I missed this one as we were in the final furlong!”  Another person said, “Our team had to rush until the end, having crazy changes happening but [our project] ended up being amazing!”</p>
					<p>The sense of accomplishment described in the entries extended to the whole hackathon, not just individuals’ own teams: “I'm now watching what everyone else has created and am amazed at what has been achieved in such a short amount of time.”</p>

					<h3>
						Sixth Round
					</h3>
					<p>The 6th diaries were euphoric in tone, reflecting a sense of accomplishment and transformative change throughout the experience:</p>
					<p>“Massively impressed with some of the work, and the overall spirit of the event. My first but not last hackathon. So much to inform my process, not just the tech.”</p>
					<p>“It's been... A-M-A-Z-I-N-G.  I wish we could do this all week.”</p>
					<p>“Im so so so so happy! I can't believe explain how proud I am of my team and I.</p>
					<p>The feedback from everyone was so positive and I think we did a brilliant job! I had so much fun experiencing everyone elses [sic] awesome creations as well.”</p>
					
					<h3>Outcomes</h3>
					<p>One challenge of a project like this is that researchers are unlikely to receive negative feedback from self-selecting participants.  People simply choose to opt out rather than to describe a process that isn’t working for them.  The diary attrition rate may be in part because people did not see the value in leaving commentary describing non-functioning processes--this is valuable for the organisers to help enact future change, but it may not be perceived as valuable for the participants who are in the middle of something they’re not enjoying.  The same is true for the hackathon itself: one of the organisers pointed out that “Teams that didn't communicate well seemed to leave.”  In this case the outcome of the ‘Storming’ phase was resolved by a group member leaving, rather than finding a way to become fully integrated in the group.</p>
					<p>This raises the interesting question of whether attrition is always negative for the group formation process.  On one hand, if there is no cohesion at all and none of the groups manage to stick together, the hackathon can’t finish.  On the other, some amount of this self-selecting strategy may actually help each group overall, because it means that only the committed and motivated members stay to finish the project.</p>
					<p>In an environment like the Art Hackathon, conflicts arising from the stages of group development need to be negotiated and resolved very quickly in order for groups to reach productive stages.  For a person who is feeling significantly at odds with their own group, it seems unlikely that these challenges can be resolved without further mediation to facilitate this process.  This could be facilitated by additional ‘decision arenas’ which allow people who are struggling to adapt to a role in one group to experiment with other groups.  These could take the form of regular updates from groups who are seeking particular skills, allowing others to join their group and offer to contribute.  Another option would be a whiteboard or message board where each group could post needs as they arise, allowing participants to view and respond to skills needs outside their own group continuously rather than during predetermined intervals.  There could also be a more active role for the organisers and volunteers to regularly gather feedback from individuals, identify people who are struggling, and provide one-on-one suggestion or directions on how to move forward.</p>
					<p>The people who responded most positively in the diaries consistently expressed feelings of excitement, inspiration, and accomplishment as the weekend progressed.  Though they faced challenges in technical success and in group productivity, they were able to consistently make progress.  By the end of the weekend, they all expressed a sense of accomplishment or connection with the entire event, not just the projects they had individually participated in.  Further, from most people there was a strong sense of future impact or ongoing change to their own work.  This came through in participants’ statements that they are looking forward to future hackathons or that they are taking away skills that will inform both technical and non-technical processes for their own future projects outside the hackathon.</p>
