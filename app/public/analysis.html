						<h1>Ethnography - participant/observation analysis</h1>
					</div>
					
					<h2>Method</h2>
					<p>Participant-observation allows researchers to gain experiential knowledge of the community being studied both by observing their activities at close range and taking part in some of those activities to gain deeper knowledge.  During the hackathon one researcher was available to conduct participant-observation, principally spending time observing the ‘Emoti’ group.  The ‘Emoti’ team ultimately produced a 3D-printed visual representation of changing emotional states on Twitter using a combination of various technologies.</p>
					<h3>
						<p>Day One</p>
					</h3>
					<p>Many participants commented on how the addition of ‘art’ with Hackathon lowered the barrier to entry for many individuals – technologists and creative alike – who felt they didn’t have the appropriate tech skills for a ‘proper Hackathon’</p>
					<p>Many agreed and commented on the importance of community.  There was a strong sense of the significance of fostering a mood of playfulness and openness during the event.  Specifically, the fact that the hackathon provided a space for creative work outside of the need to produce an economically viable product appeared to appeal to people’s sense of creative ingenuity.  This community ethos included the perceived benefits of the event not being associated with a corporate presence: the freedom to explore ideas outside of a commercial framework was for many a highlight of the event.</p>
					<p>Several participants also expressed the idea that hackathons which are thematically focused like the Art Hackathon and Hack the Barbican act as gateway introductory experiences.  For people who want to experiment with technology but who have concerns about their acceptance among a group of highly technically adept peers, this perceived lower barrier to entry allows some people to gain the confidence to explore.</p>
					<p>For those who already feel fairly confident in their existing technical skills, hackathons like these offer a materialization of a community.  Even if only for a brief time (two days in the case of the Art Hackathon), this is a community they can physically connect with. Moreover, for both those who identify as ‘techies’ and those who may not, these connections appear to be lasting: participants appear to form connections with other individuals or groups which may lead them into future events or communities that bridge both technical and non-technical realms.  Participants who had prior experience with other hackathons also reported a lasting sense of connection with a community of like-minded individuals which can be renewed by participating in further similar events.</p>
					<p>It appeared to be common to most groups that after an initial ideation session comprising all participants, the ‘tech’ and ‘creative’ groups split into separate smaller teams working at different tables. Although a necessary evil to some extent (for example, it is not ideal to have a soldering station next to someone making a cardboard model), this migration and separation of tech and art isn’t conducive to trying to get the two camps to work collaboratively. This separation means that the probability of knowledge transfer between the two groups is greatly reduced.  How will an artist who came to the event with the intention to become more acquainted with coding be able to become comfortable and accustomed to the terminology and nature of the process when she is separated from it? This sense of tension at being thrust back into the predefined role of one’s existing skill set in order to accomplish the desired outcomes within the defined time, rather than having the leisure to explore and learn new skills, appeared to affect several participants.</p>
					<p>Further, a problem that seemed to be particularly common among the artists and creatives was was an apparent sense of being unsure of what was possible. There was a feeling of frustration and trepidation among designers/artists who had concepts, but didn’t understand the capabilities of the technologies (both the software and the hardware). Rather than treating this as a collaborative process of discovery, those who did have the technical skill to understand the possibilities and limitations of the various technologies available appeared to want a more traditional brief or requirements list.  Their apparent preference was to receive a bulleted list of creative direction and then to conduct the technical work in a siloed manner without further input from the creative team.</p>
					<p>One commonly expressed frustration throughout the day was the desire to bridge digital and physical technologies, predominantly through interfacing code and software with hardware such as Raspberry Pi and Arduino. However, each team found this very difficult to teach themselves. There could be an opportunity here for event organisers to provide additional expertise and help in this area to reduce barrier to entry for participants wishing to work in these areas who have little prior experience.</p>
					<p>Despite these frustrations around communication and technical skills, ‘creativity for creativity’s sake’ reigned as an implicit stance throughout the event.  This encouraged teams to develop ideas that served no commercial purpose, ideas that most participants who ordinarily work in commercial roles would not otherwise have had the opportunity to explore.  The event became an outlet for creativity: there was a common sense that creative expression is frequently stifled in the workplace given commerce and industry’s obsession with efficiency and productivity.  This unfettered creativity was highlighted by the many impractical or non-commercially valuable ideas championed during the pitch phase.  Many of these ideas had a sense of humanistic positivity and warmth, with their prevailing aims being outcomes that would foment community formation or global connection through creating systems that promoted positivity or irreverence.</p>
					<p>In the afternoon of day 1, a wrap-up/stand-up/check-in point was arranged to allow all the groups to present their progress.  As part of this, groups also shared their sticking points or aspects of the project that were causing frustration where they needed additional help.  This allowed people the opportunity to move between groups as they offered skill sets that the groups were initially lacking.  Making use of check-in points like these could be one way to foster connections between participants in different groups, as well as allowing groups the opportunity to approach problems in new ways with fresh skill sets.  Mealtimes also allow people the opportunity to foster their sense of community with others by mingling with people outside their own groups.</p>
					<h3>
						<p>Day Two</p>
					</h3>
					<p>Between day one and day two, several participants chose not to return.  While some of these were planned (the participants knew when signing up that they were only going to be able to attend one day), the principal reason for attrition appeared to be a mismatch between desired and possible hackathon outcomes.  These mainly focused around failing to find a match between needs and skills.  At any event like this, it seems unlikely to expect 100% attendance by all participants on both days.  However, there may be ways to mediate some of the observed dropout cases.  For those participants who felt that the skills they had weren’t needed, or that the learning curve to assist would be too overwhelming to accomplish their creative goals, there may be a way to mediate the goals early in the process to enable an adjustment in their expectations so that they still feel motivated and engaged throughout the weekend.</p>
					<p>The most successful teams appeared to be those who were able to flexibly adjust their creative concepts to match the technical capabilities and tools at hand, recognizing that time constraints may be a damper to their creative and educational ambitions.  In some cases this happened on the second day after people had the opportunity to leave the problem overnight and approach it with fresh eyes in the morning.  This speaks again to the tension between wanting to learn new things and explore new skill areas, but feeling the pressure of relying on familiar skill sets to get the job done before time runs out.</p>
					<p>Though some teams were still making radical changes on the second day, for most teams the second day was past the ideation and experimentation stages and well into making mode, focusing primarily on getting materials together in time for presentation.</p>
					<p>During the presentations many teams focused on their process as well as their final product.  In many cases (Stepping Stones, Museum of Lies, Emoti, All Smoke, No Mirrors, etc.) participants described exploring a number of different techniques or trains of thought before deciding on the final mechanism or process that actually made the finished product work.  Some teams actually went quite far down a particular route before realising they’d need to rethink their technical solution entirely, which in some cases also reshaped the creative direction of the project.</p>
					<p>While people expressed a sense of community through connections formed at this hackathon and others, the very brief exhibition of finished products on the second day seemed to leave many feeling that the outcomes were too ephemeral or transient.  A longer time to display and share works and to continue to collaborate on or react to the projects may be beneficial for fomenting continuation of that sense of community.</p>
					<h2>
						<p>Outcomes</p>
					</h2>
					<p>Groups of three to five appeared to work well: small enough to progress quickly through work and to have a sense of directed focus, large enough to have a mix of skills and enough hands to get ambitious work done</p>
					<p>Additional hands-on support, particularly with bridging the gap between hardware and software elements, would be beneficial for future projects.</p>
					<p>Some setup time is invariably spent on getting set up and finding common tools for development and collaboration.  It may be helpful to have some advance suggestions about this, like links to free or open source tools (especially if there will be experienced people at the hackathon who can assist with setup.)</p>
					<p>One challenge around allowing people to self-select for each group is the difficulty in predicting how the resulting mix of skills will be able to address the technical and artistic aspects of the project.  In some cases, the sense of mismatch between skills and needs may lead to participant attrition.  However, one positive aspect of self-selection is that it forces groups to approach projects with a mix of pragmatism and creativity that may lead to greater innovation.</p>
					<p>Methods for allowing people to remain connected beyond the hackathon may help build a sense of momentum and community.  Social media can help with this, as would longer-term exhibition space for the projects.</p>
