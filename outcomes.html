					<h1>Research Purpose</h1> 

					<p>As stated on the Research page:</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>To help us understand the process of the hackathon as well as its material outcomes, we will be conducting qualitative research. This will give us insight on how teams form and collaborate throughout the event, both formally and informally. We will use this research to improve future hackathons, both future iterations of this one and those run by other organisers.</p>
					</blockquote>
					<h2>
						<p>Research methods</p>
					</h2>
					<h3>
						<p>Remote collection</p>
					</h3>
					<p>One of the challenges of this particular research was that the original researcher couldn’t actually be present during the event.  Would it even be possible to collect ethnographic data without physically being there to conduct participant-observation?  We decided to experiment with qualitative methods that would in essence have the participants themselves do the bulk of the data collection and documentation, which could then be remotely analyzed later.  To this end, we encouraged participants to post their own multimedia observations on social media during the event and to write follow-up commentary in the form of blogs. We collected these in a Storify to act as a living, collaboratively editable record of both the process and the outcomes of the hackathon.</p>
					<p>We also set up a diaries project in which volunteer participants received semi-random prompts throughout the event to submit diaries about their work.</p>
					<p>For more on the diaries, read the <a href="diaries.html">Art Hackathon: Diaries Analysis entry</a>.</p>
					<h3>
						<p>Participant-observation</p>
					</h3>
					<p>The opportunity for a trained researcher to conduct direct observations during the event arose late in the event planning.  These comprised participant-observation and interviews with people at the hackathon. This mixed-methods approach enabled us to compare the type of observations we could make from remote data collection with the observational data collected during the event itself.</p>
					<p>For more on the participant-observation: read the <a href="analysis.html">Art Hackathon: Participant-Observation Analysis entry</a></p>
					<p>Based on our experience using both methods, we believe that while both choices have value, they are suitable for different purposes: the value of the diaries was in its privacy and opportunity to provide data anonymously.  The immediacy of completing the hackathon projects took precedence, however, and of the participants who agreed to submit diaries very few completed all six entries. During a focused event like the hackathon, it is difficult for participants to stop responding to the direct pressures in the room in order to focus on the more reflexive practice of diarising.  It did allow them to share thoughts that they may not have been comfortable sharing publicly, however.</p>
					<h2>
						<p>Research outcomes</p>
					</h2>
					<h3>
						<p>Aspirations of profundity balanced by realism</p>
					</h3>
					<p>In much of the participant-observation, there was a clear concern about managing the conflicting goals of producing a piece of technology that isn’t merely functional but inspirational, and trying to explore and experiment with new skills.  This ties in with the perceived barrier to entry to participate at hackathons.  At this event some participants mentioned that the artistic element made them feel that they would not be overwhelmed by the technical requirements, and even though they may not self-identify as a ‘techie’ they felt comfortable signing up.  However, though the environment was welcoming, collaborative and encouraging, the realities of trying to accomplish complex tasks in a limited time also forced many participants to default to existing areas of expertise or roles they already perform elsewhere rather than learning new things.</p>
					<p>One way to manage this desire for skills acquisition or experimental space could be to have additional, optional time for learning specific skill sets that might be helpful during the event.  Technical advice on specific hardware and software components could be especially helpful for events focusing on crafting physical objects.</p>
					<p>Another way to look at this might be the hackathon as inspiration: perhaps individuals didn’t pick up the specific skill sets that they intended to learn or to experiment with, but now that they can see its potential, their long-term personal development goals may change.  An area for future research could be follow-up studies with hackathon participants to determine whether their working methods changed through time, what steps they took, and whether they remained connected with their original goals from the hackathon or changed over time.</p>
					<h3>
						<p>Creativity in a non-commercial context</p>
					</h3>
					<p>Another clear theme during the hackathon was the opportunity to play and to experiment with ideas outside commercially-oriented context.  The hackathon allowed people to bring their technical and artistic skills to bear on ideas that were much more self-determined than those normally encountered in commercial enterprises.  Several participants and the guest artists who gave talks on the first day framed these creative ideas as being ‘pointless’ or grounded in creativity for its own sake.  In keeping with the hackathon’s theme of ‘trickery,’ many of the resultant products conveyed a sense of optimism or irreverence about humanity’s ability to subvert closed systems for unexpected ends.</p>
					<h3>
						<p>Community materialization, collaboration, and group development</p>
					</h3>
					<p>Another aspect of non-commercial creative endeavours like the Art Hackathon is how important the procedural and community impact outcomes are in measuring success.</p>
					<p>There is a sense among the participants that the Art Hackathon and similar events allow people to form and maintain connections with a like-minded community of technically inclined creatives.  Getting people together personally facilitates communication.  The time limitation forces people to develop rapport very quickly as a group in order to define and to work towards accomplishing a goal.  Allowing people to self-organise encourages creative and innovative problem-solving as the mix of skills and thus methods for approaching various challenges in any group is unpredictable.</p>
					<p>The fact that this hackathon specifically included an artistic element also contributed to the diversity of skills present: some participants mentioned that they felt more comfortable signing up for this event because they were not intimidated by fears about keeping up with strenuous technical requirements.</p>
					<p>The ethos of openness, sharing and collaboration is one of the hackathon’s greatest successes: in observation and feedback through the diaries, people were proud not only of what they had accomplished but how they were able to work together to produce those material outcomes.</p>
					<h3>
						<p>Future Research Ideas</p>
					</h3>
					<p>One potential area for future research could be the longitudinal impact of attending a hackathon on participants’ work and professional development practices.  In cases where people experimented with but ultimately abandoned a particular technical strategy, did those people choose to learn more about that technology afterwards?  Were any of the abandoned  ideas generated during the ideation period picked up and later worked on outside the hackathon?  Do teams continue to stay in touch and inform one another’s creative processes?  How is the sense of community which is generated or reaffirmed during the hackathon maintained outside the event itself?</p>
